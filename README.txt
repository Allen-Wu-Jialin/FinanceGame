# FinanceGame
This is a finance based game that will teach people how to manage and grow their finances through their daily lives. Each new day is presented with various challenges and daily choices the player must make in order to advance.
The choices that the player makes will affect their different status: happiness, hunger, fitness, and fatigue. 
The goal of the game is freeplay: ultimately that helps players recognize how participating in a particular activity/challenge may fluctuate different statuses simultaneously. It is recommended for the player to maintain equilibrium in all statuses while participating in each challenge.
